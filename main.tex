The people in the following sections are just some of the siblings of the family members in our "CFB" family history document -  in each family I found out interesting information about the various off shoots of the families, and it would be a pity to lose these stories.  Obviously there are plenty of other members of the different branches who would deserve a section to themselves, but this is a sample of the stories I uncovered during the process of researching our family tree.
