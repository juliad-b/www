    M.  Mary Gullock (add)

m. 1 October 1637

    \uppercaseJohn Hill - 1723
    James Hill


\uppercase{Joseph Hill} was born in 1700 and married \uppercase{Mary ?} in 1726,  They had four children: Joseph Hill, \uppercase{John Hill}, who was \uppercase{Ralph Mundy Denton Barker}'s , Robert Hill, and Elizabeth Hill.

\sctext{Joseph Hill} Joseph Hill was born in 1727 and married Mary Saunders on 19 July 1752 in Paulton, Somerset.  Presumably she died as he then married Christian Langford on 5 January 1759 in Paulton. He was a coalmaster, and after his death on
30 September 1767, in his will (Probate 25 March 1768) he left to Mrs Christian (Kitty) Hill ``indenture land in Paulton... including the engine house, fire engine, outhouses and stables and tools, and things for mining..''.  The significance of this is that the mine would be worthless without the above ground machinery. 

Their third son was \sctext{Robert Hill} who was born in 1731. He married Mary Ames, and was a butcher. He died in 1787. 	

The youngest child was \sctext{Elizabeth Hill}. All that is known of her is that she married a Thomas Palmer in Timsbury, Somerset, and they had at least one child, Mary Palmer.
