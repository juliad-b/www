\section{Hill}

\subsection{FIRST GENERATIONS}

The earliest record of a Hill in this line was \uppercase{Robert Hill} who was born in High Littleton, Somerset. He married \uppercase{Isabel Greste} and they had at least one son, \uppercase{Robert Hill}. He died about 1607.
\uppercase{Robert Hill} had at least one son, another \uppercase{John Hill} and in turn he had at least one son, again called Robert.

\subsection{SECOND GENERATION}

\uppercase{Robert Hill} was born in Paulton, Somerset and in 1637 he was living at Paulton House in Paulton. He married \uppercase{Mary Gullock} on 1 October 1637 in Timsbury, Somerset.  They had two sons: \uppercase{John Hill} and \textsc{James Hill, of whom nothing is known.

\subsection{THIRD GENERATION}

\uppercase{John Hill} was born in Paulton, and he married Elizabeth James.  They had three children: \uppercase{Joseph Hill}, John Hill and Elizabeth Hill.

\textsc{John Hill} lived in Paulton, and married Mary Anthony. They had four daughters.  He was engaged in mining coal in the area near Paulton.  In 1716 he leased out the mining rights under Grindstone and Allard’s Ham. This was the land between the Hallatrow-Paulton Road and the Cam brook, almost opposite the entrance to Butts Lane:

\end{quotation}
The manor of Hallatrow, where he lived, remained in the Hill family until the early 18th century. When he died in May 1738,  his Hallatrow estate was left to his four daughters, whose husbands put it up for sale. Amongst the prospective purchasers was Joseph Langton of Newton Park, Newton St. Loe, who commissioned a survey of the estate in 1716, from which it is obvious that coalmining activity was or had been going on before then. Amongst the details were: ``Survey of Hallatrow Farm, 1716 Schedule of land and property including: Coale Pitt Ground Pasture 3 acres Value £2 per acre (1720 in 2 closes) Whole estate 135½ acres let to James Collins @ £90 p.a. For timber & Coale £100 + 3 tenements & closes let to others Value of timber, Coale & Herriotts £10.''

30 September 1767, in his will (Probate 25 March 1768) he left to Mrs Christian (Kitty) Hill ``indenture land in Paulton... including the engine house, fire engine, outhouses and stables and tools, and things for mining..''.  (The significance of this is that the mine would be worthless without the above ground machinery.) His will also read: ``Will of Said Joseph Hill of Paulton Somerset Coalmaster:  First I do request and hereby authorise my wife Christian Hill if she can within six calendar months next after my decease to buy and purchase of and from my brothers John Hill, Robert Hill and my sister Elizabeth Palmer, widow, all their and each and every of their part of the coalworks..."

  also of Christian Hill widow of the above Joseph Hill who died 12th day of July 1807 aged 72 years.''
